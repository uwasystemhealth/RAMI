    "Routing of power traces has been kept to the outside of the board as much as possible as the power traces predominantly run vertically up the plane. \n",
    "Data traces are predominantly in the center of the board, vertical traces are run  along the top layer of the board and horizontal traces along the bottom layer in order to minimise the number of vias required. \n",
    "20mil traces have been used in all instances, although this is much wider than the required trace width (5mil) it provides a 4-fold reduction in trace resistance. \n",
    "The ATMega328 was placed centrally on the board to minimise the length of data traces, with the longest data trace being 47mm for the ISP clock signal. \n",
    "The crystal oscillator has also been placed in close proximity to the ATMega328P as it is the highest frequency signal run along a trace on the board. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the board could be further reduced by placing the LoRa module on the underside of the board, however for ease of testing, development and manufacture it was decided to keep all components on one plane in this iteration. \n",
    "The vertical header along the top right side of the board provides a breakout for the unused pins on the ATMega328P and the second accelerometer interrupt. \n",
    "Most of these pins are multipurpose digital/analog pins, this allows for the connection of both analog and digital sensors to the platform. \n",
    "The RFM95W digital outputs are broken out on the bottom right of the board. \n",
    "The behaviour of these pins is configurable through SPI and allows for signals such as; end transmission, packet received, and channel busy to be used as inputs to other devices ([RFM95/96/97/98(W) - Low Power Long Range Transceiver Module'' HopeRF, 2006](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/8/0/4/RFM95_96_97_98W.pdf)). \n",
    "The horizontal header along the top right of the board is a serial communications header. \n",
    "The layout order for the serial communications header is: DTR, MRX, MTX, 3.3V, CTR, GND. \n",
    "This layout makes it compatible with the headers on off the shelf 3.3V serial adapters without the need for manual wiring. \n",
    "The header on the top left is an In-System Programming (ISP) header, this allows for the ATMega328P to be programmed directly without the need for a boot loader. \n",
    "Using this method saves on program space and decreases the startup time for the device. \n",
    "The LoRa module in the center of the board towards the lower third has been positioned upside down relative to the board, the main reason for this decision is to keep the antenna trace away from all clocked data signals. \n",
    "The antenna trace is the single header towards the bottom right of the board. \n",
    "This trace was kept as short as possible and is ground shielded on its plane to reduce interference. \n",
    "The power control circuit is located on the bottom left of the board. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest method of manufacture of this board is via reflow soldering for all SMD components, followed by iron soldering of the through hole components and LoRa module. \n",
    "A working board was also developed using a fixed heat gun to mount the ADXL345 and using a soldering iron to mount all other components.\n",
